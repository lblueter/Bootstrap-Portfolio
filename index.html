                        Hello! My name is Logan Blueter, I am an aspiring web developer from Ohio. I graduated from Highland Highschool in 2013.
                        I currently live with my parents and my two younger sisters. We have two dogs and two cats. My father
                        was in the Army for six years working with network security and we have always been big into computers
                        and technology. When I was younger my dad and I made a website for our family together thought he
                        did most the work and I just picked out pictures and old flash games to embed in the page. That was
                        my first experience with web design and I have been interested since then. Though I haven’t had much
                        experience coding I have had much experience with computer software and hardware and know the basics.
                        I have built my own computer and have setup my own network as well as doing the same for various
                        friends and family. Much of what I know is thanks to my family and I owe a lot to them. I am currently
                        looking forward to the new knowledge and experience I am going to gain at the Case Western Reserve
                        University Coding Bootcamp. Someday I hope to make a great career out of the skills I am going to
                        be learning over the next 6 months.
